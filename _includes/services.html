                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">I'm constantly looking for more fun projects that I complete during evenings and weekends.
                      I've been using these projects to develop additional skills while I work full-time as a Mechanical Engineer within the space industry.
                      I have a keen interest in all things related to engineering, robotics and programming. </h3>

                    <p class="text-muted">I am proficient in Solidworks, and have produced thousands of bespoke models and drawings of mechanical parts for satellites, aircrafts and robotics.
                      I am able to operate 3D printers and use them for prototyping using FDM filament and SLS resin. I also have experience with Blender, Fusion 360 and Vizualise for organic modelling, rendering, animations and simulation.                         I have designed a Logos for 2 companies. I have also used Blender to create scenes in Space using NASA images to showoff technology to be used in satellites to include in bids.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Having built and maintained a few websites now, I am quite capable of building from templates for wordpress sites or Jekyll. I'm trying to pickup as much programming skills as possible to expand on the AI course I completed at University which entailed genetic and evolutionary algorithms.
                    I have used Python to write scripts to count microscopic fibres using OpenCV. I've been learning JS for web design, learning Swift for writing iOS applications, and have started using Arduino and Unity3D for my projects related to AI robotics.</p>
