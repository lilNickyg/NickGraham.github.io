                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">I have been looking into doing some projects at home that include Web Design, programming and Blender to develop my skills while I work full-time as a Mechanical Design Engineer. I have a keen interest in computer science, and am planning to become a Charted Engineer with the IMechE in 2020.</h3>

                    <p class="text-muted">I am proficient in Solidworks, and have produced hundreds of bespoke models and drawings of mechanical parts for satellites, pressure vessels and landing gear.
                       I am also able to operate 3D printers and use them for prototyping. I have also worked as an FE Engineer working with ANSYS, ABAQUS, OpenFOAM, Elmer, Calculix, Paraview, MSC NASTRAN, PATRAN and Adams</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Having built 2 websites now, I am quite capable of building from templates for wordpress sites or Jekyll. I'm trying to pickup as much programming skills as possible to expand on the AI course I completed at University which entailed genetic and evolutionary algorithms.
                    I have used Python to write custom commands in ABAQUS and for counting microscopic fibres using OpenCV. I've been learning JS for web design, learning Swift for writing iOS applications, and have started tutorials for Unity3D for my interest in building games.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I have been using Blender to learn tutorials on organic modelling to aid with 3D printing design, but also looking into the "photoshop" aspect to create majestic scenes.
                       I have designed a Logo for 1 company in 2018. I have also used Blender to create scenes in Space using NASA images to showoff technology to be used in satellites to include in bids.</p>
