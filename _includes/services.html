                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">I have been looking into doing some projects at home that include Web Design, programming and Blender to develop my skills while I work full-time as a Mechanical Design Engineer. I have a keen interest in computer science, and am planning to become a Charted Engineer with the IMechE within the next 2 years.</h3>

                    <p class="text-muted">I am proficient in Solidworks, and have produced hundreds of bespoke models and drawings of mechanical parts for sattalies, pressure vesseles and landing gear.
                       I also will be getting a 3D printer in April 2019 and hope to use it for prototyping and product manufacuturing. I have also worked as an FE Engineer working with ANSYS but have used ABAQUS in my FYP at university and dipped my toes into Elmer, Calculix, Paraview and OpenFOAM. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Having built 2 websites now, I am quite capable of building from templates for wordpress sites or Jekyll. I'm trying to pickup as much programming skills as possible.
                    I have used Python to write custom commands in ABAQUS (FEA), learning JS for web design, and learning swift to aid with writing iOS applications, but will probably look into using Unity from this point on as I have more of an interest in building games.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I have been using Blender to learn tutorials on organic modelling to aid with 3D printing design, but also looking into the "photoshop" aspect to create majestic scenes.
                       I have designed a Logo for 1 company in 2018. I have also used Blender to create scenes in Space using NASA images to showoff technology to be used in satellites to include in bids.</p>
