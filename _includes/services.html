                      programming and Blender to develop my skills while I work full-time as a Mechanical Design Engineer.
                      I have a keen interest in computer science, and have recent achieve chartered status with the IMechE</h3>

                    <p class="text-muted">3D modelling and Simualation are my areas of greatest experitise. I am proficient in Solidworks, and have produced thousands of bespoke models and drawings of mechanical parts for satellites, aircrafts and robotics.
                       I am also able to operate 3D printers and use them for prototyping primarily using SLS resin. I have work as an FE & CFD Engineer having worked with ANSYS, ABAQUS, FEMAP, OpenFOAM, Elmer, Calculix, Paraview, MSC NASTRAN, PATRAN and Adams</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Having built 2 websites now, I am quite capable of building from templates for wordpress sites or Jekyll. I'm trying to pickup as much programming skills as possible to expand on the AI course I completed at University which entailed genetic and evolutionary algorithms.
                    I have used Python to write custom commands in ABAQUS and for counting microscopic fibres using OpenCV. I've been learning JS for web design, learning Swift for writing iOS applications, and have started tutorials for Unity3D for my interest in AI robotics simulation</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I have limited experience with Blender but am learning tutorials on organic modelling to aid with 3D printing design, and have used it for rendering CGI animations.
                       I have designed a Logos for 2 companies. I have also used Blender to create scenes in Space using NASA images to showoff technology to be used in satellites to include in bids.</p>
