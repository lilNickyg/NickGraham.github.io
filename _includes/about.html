                                      I honed my CAD and FEA skills on Solidworks and ANSYS, whilst learning other packages.
                                      I taught myself how to use CNC machines and program them in G-Code.
                                      I designed a new website for the company after learning html css amd js at home.
                                      I also setup a server for the company on a PC for filesharing and database storage using Windows Server 2012 R2, keeping to strict security regulations as expected in the Space sector. </p>
