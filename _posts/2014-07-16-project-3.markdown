description: Learning Python to use in conjunction with my Raspberry Pi 3 model B. After setting up some basic stuff like a Network Ad Blocker, Kodi Home Theater Software and Parsec, I'm currently planning to connect some LEDs to the Pi and use Python to program them to act as an ambilight for the TV.
